# Sorting Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of common **sorting algorithms** written mainly for learning and practice purposes.  
It also includes result files to help compare algorithm performance.

---

## Contents

- Implementations of classic sorting algorithms
- Sample input/output handling
- CSV files with execution results for comparison

---

## Implemented Algorithms

- Bubble Sort  
- Selection Sort  
- Insertion Sort  
- Merge Sort  
- Quick Sort  

(Algorithms are implemented in separate files for clarity.)
